Overview 

This project is a machine learning mini-project focused on building a classifier to identify shoe brands based on image data. The project leverages feature extraction techniques and various machine learning models to achieve accurate classification.

The goal of this project is to develop a classifier that can identify different shoe brands using images. The project involves the following main steps: Data Collection, Feature Extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Model Training using various classifiers, Model Evaluation and Selection.

The dataset consists of images of shoes from different brands. The data is organized into training and testing directories, each containing subdirectories for each shoe brand. The HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) method is used for feature extraction.

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Grid search with cross-validation is used to tune the hyperparameters of these models. The best models are then combined using a Voting Classifier for improved accuracy.
